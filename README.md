# Jan Riethmayer

## Hi there 👋

🤖 My name is Jan Riethmayer and I hail from the bustling metropolis of London. I'm a father of two amazing daughters and am looking for my next big opportunity.

🌍 I live in London 🇬🇧 since 2016 and grew up in Berlin-Kreuzberg 🇩🇪🇹🇷. My mom is from Serbia 🇷🇸, my dad is a Swabian🇩🇪. I speak more Turkish than Serbian, which actually doesn‘t mean much 😂.

💍I am husband to a 🔬scientist and 🏋️‍♀️feminist (a.k.a. The Boss) and passionate about 🌈 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI). I turned father during a Series A and took 3 months paternity leave to lead by example, while relying on a world class team at Zencargo.

💾 I love product and tech (polyglot programmer).
If I had a tattoo, it would be a Ruby-tattoo (my first intimate and loving relationship with programming).
Currently I'm mostly playing with `Python`, `Firebase`, `Typescript`  and `React`, but I also love `Go`, `Elixir` and `R`.

📚I love reading with a 90:5:5 ratio of non-fiction to fiction (sci-fi, fantasy, history) and you need to tell me if I annoy you with book recommendations. Check out my [GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/72601141-jan-riethmayer)

🏀 I was addicted to playing street-ball, 🛹 loved to skate, was a competitive breakdancer, hobby freestyle rapper 🎙 and Bundesliga MTG player 🃟. I fought 10 years for the Horde 😈 (World of Warcraft). I am mostly playing with my kids at the moment (and loving it).
